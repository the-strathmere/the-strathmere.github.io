![The Strathmere - Leather Weekend Bag - Shown gracefully resting on the porch of a beach house](assets/img/product-photos/The Strathmere - Leather Weekend Bag - A. M. Aiken - 06.jpeg)

**The Strathmere** is the only leather weekend bag you‚Äôll ever need. With more than 2,600 cubic inches of available volume The Strathmere will effortlessly hold what you need for that much needed long-weekend out of town. I like to pack for Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday. The Strathmere has no problem doing so. Quantities are limited, each bag is numbered.

Pack, bring that book, the one you‚Äôve been meaning to read. Coffee on the road. Leave work behind, the sun will set during the drive. 

Highways, by ways, and tolls. Bridges, cities, roads. Beach towel and sandals tucked safely inside. 

One-lane bridge, you are close. Empty streets, the town sleeps.  

Waves crash against the shore, grab your bag and open the door. Time to unwind, leave your worries behind.

**The Strathmere** - an exquisite leather weekend bag. Shaped from 5 feet of continuous leather, a design marvel of its own. Easily stow what you need for that weekend getaway you‚Äôve been putting off, plus any extras that are required (unread books, necessary hair dryer, coffee snobbery items, etc). The ample space will fit just about everything you need to escape for a weekend. Leather Straps and buckles keep everything secure, dual flap closure ensures nothing will fall out, also keeps things dry if there‚Äôs a chance of rain from your car to the beach house. Handles for quick grab-and-go. 

Take that trip, pack this bag, and send a postcard!

## Annual Quantities are Limited
My yearly output of _The Strathmere_ is very limited. Once I reach the yearly quantity I will close sales for that given calendar year. 

As this is launching mid-2024 it will be a limited edition in that this Series (Series I) will have fewer bags available, Series II will be available beginning in 2025 and will include a standard full Series of bags.

Be the one of the first to own a Series I of _The Strathmere_!
